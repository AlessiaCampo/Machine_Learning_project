# Machine_Learning_project
This repository contains the Machine Learnig project pipeline file .ipynb- created and executed in a Google Colab notebook. It consists of different steps that aim to present the MNIST Digit dataset and its usage in the ML field. Different ML models are trained, tested and compared in the ability of classify the dataset.

To run and excecute the pipeline, the access to Google colab is required.
The suggestion is to set up the Runtime in GPU to make the process faster.
