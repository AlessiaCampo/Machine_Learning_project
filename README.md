# Machine_Learning_project
This repository contains the Machine Learnig project pipeline implemented in Google Colab. It consists of different steps that aim to present the MNIST Digit dataset and its usage in the ML field. Different ML models are trained, tested and compared.
To run the pipeline, it is just requiered an access to Google colab
The suggestion is to set up the Runtime in GPU to make the process faster.
